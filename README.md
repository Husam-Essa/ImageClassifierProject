# Image Classifier Project

 **Project for Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning with TensorFlow Nanodegree**  
In this project, I developed an **image classifier** using **TensorFlow** and converted it into a **command-line application** to classify new images.

---

##  What I Accomplished
- Built a **deep learning model** using **TensorFlow & Keras**.
- Trained the model on **102 different flower categories**.
- Created a **command-line application (CLI)** to classify new flower images.
- Used **Jupyter Notebook** for model development and analysis before converting it into a deployable script.

## **Technologies & Tools Used**
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib, PIL  
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook & Python scripts  
- **GPU Support**: The project was trained in a **GPU-enabled environment** for efficiency.
